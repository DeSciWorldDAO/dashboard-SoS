"description":"Seeds of Science is an open access journal publishing articles speculative or non-traditional articles from any scientific discipline. Our primary criterion can be distilled into one question - does your article contain original ideas or analysis that have the potential to advance science? The goal is to be as open-minded as possible about what qualifies as a useful scientific contribution (speculative hypotheses, proposals for experiments, perspectives, preliminary data analyses, etc.) and allow for a diversity of writing styles and formats (e.g. narratives, dialogues, etc.) so that authors can express their ideas in a clear and engaging manner. Peer review is conducted through community-based voting and commenting by our diverse network of reviewers ( gardeners, as we call them). ",
